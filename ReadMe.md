This is the project for the Drone Safety API, which serves heatmaps data to the front-end.
It is written using the ASP.NET core framework.

The documentation for the API is available as a swagger page.
That page describes the API endpoints and the possible query parameters for those endpoints.

src/ contains the source code for the project.
Each class has been documented by a description of the class as a whole, along with a description of all the public methods.
This documentation can be viewed in the source files themselves.
Alternatively, build the project, and navigate to:
src\DroneSafetyApi\bin\Debug\netcoreapp1.0\DroneSafetyApi.xml
for an XML file of the documentation.

test/ contains unit tests for the project.

The future prediction feature is found in the "FuturePrediction" branch.
